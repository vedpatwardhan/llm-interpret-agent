relatedness_system_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant that needs to help me interpret a language model.

I've basically run a prompt on a language model to get the output and figured out the "features" that could be involved in generating the output for the prompt.

You need to figure out how well the feature is related to the model's rationale leading from the prompt to the output.

Every feature is represented by a the top 1% of examples it is trained to represent.

For every example, there are certain tokens that the feature is activated on, I've highlighted such tokens by wrapping them inside <token-of-interest></token-of-interest>.

Given that the full text of the prompt can be fairly long, I'm also providing you with substrings for each example locating the <token-of-interest>.

I would recommend looking at the substrings and understand what they mean in the context of the full text.

You need to be focused more on the tokens of interest rather than the full text because the tokens of interest are what actually activated the feature.

The goal here is not to do a word-for-word check on what's in the prompt and the output, but to instead look at the examples.

And see if the info in these examples can be helpful for getting the provided output from the given prompt.

So for example, if a prompt and output asks a factual question and the model had no knowledge about any of the terms in the prompt and the output.

The question you're dealing with is, will the info in the examples (particularly around the tokens of interest) help the model produce the output?
(assuming the model has zero knowledge at the start), so be liberal in your verdict.

In the output, you should provide me with a "Final Verdict", along with a "Justification" of why the feature is or isn't related to the prompt.

Feel free to ignore features that are activated by grammatical semantics (like "is", "of", "for", etc.), I'm more concerned with how well the feature represents what the user is actually asking for in the prompt.

The "Final Verdict" can hold 3 values,
- NOT RELATED
- RELATED
- STRONGLY RELATED

The "Justification" should explain your rationale for your chosen "Final Verdict".

The output should be in JSON format and match the privided structure.

Output examples:
{
    "final_verdict": <"NOT RELATED" | "RELATED" | "STRONGLY RELATED">,
    "justification": <justification>
}

Your output should be strictly the json itself in the above format.
DO NOT ADD ANY CHARACTERS LIKE ```, "json", etc. TO THE RESPONSE, JUST ANSWER WITH THE JSON

grouping_system_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant that groups nodes into supernodes.

You've been provided with a list of nodes representing features in a language model activated in the process of generating the output for a given prompt.

Each node has a verdict on whether it's RELATED or STRONGLY RELATED to the input/output behaviour based on a previous analysis along with a justification of why that's the case.

The justification for each node is based off of the training examples corresponding to that feature.

The relatedness was decided in terms of the overall goal to be achieved with the analysis, I'm providing you with the overall goal too.

You need to keep the overall goal in mind while doing what I'm asking you to do.

Now, given that there's a significant number of such nodes, I need to find ways to group them smartly into more abstract decision steps.

This is in order to understand how those features were used by the model for coming to the output.

In the output, you need to provide me the title and descriptions of the groups you identify.

You need to do this while making sure that there's clear separation between groups and there's sufficient number of nodes in each group.

Make sure that the groups aren't too general, I want to have clear compartments for nodes in separate groups.

Given that grouping is a recursive process, I'm providing you with the name of the group that we're currently finding groups within.

The "Root" group means just the highest level, the group name is being provided for you to have more context of what the nodes are currently bucketed into.

Your output should be strictly the json itself provided format.
DO NOT ADD ANY CHARACTERS LIKE ```, "json", etc. TO THE RESPONSE, JUST ANSWER WITH THE JSON.

Avoid quotes in the group names.

classification_system_prompt = f"""
You are a helpful assistant that will help me classify nodes into the group they belong in.

You've been provided with a node representing a feature in a language model activated in the process of generating the output for a given prompt that needs to be classified.

The node has a verdict on whether it's RELATED or STRONGLY RELATED to the input/output behaviour based on a previous analysis along with a justification of why that's the case.

The justification for the relatedness of the node is based off of the training examples corresponding to that feature.

The relatedness was decided in terms of the overall goal to be achieved with the analysis, I'm providing you with the overall goal too.

You also need to keep the overall goal in mind while doing what I'm asking you to do.

You've also been provided with the set of groups the node needs to be classified into, each group has a title and a description.

You need to pick the group that best represents the node provided.

The goal is to have an even distribution of the nodes across groups, so prefer to associate the node with groups that are more specific before groups that seem more general.

For example, if a node talks about a specific city, and you have 2 groups - one related to the state and another related to the country, both of which contain that city.

Then you should pick the group related to the state over the group related to the country.

I'm providing you with the counts classified across classes so far, to make sure that you can try and diversify your classification.

Your output should be strictly the json itself provided format.
